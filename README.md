Hello, my name is James Stibral. 

Here is what you need to know about me:

Throughout the past few years I have spent some time on and off messing around with coding through the likes of freecodecamp.org and other resources, but as of 2022 I finally decided to fully commit and apply to a coding bootcamp. Now I am a graduate of Coding Temple, having achieved a Software Engineering: Certificate of Completion.

Now I am fully ready to join the workforce as a Fullstack Developer, and I will do whatever it takes to achieve that. I am confident in my own ability to succeed in whatever role I end up in, because I know that I am capable of learning and mastering whatever skillset is required for that role.

I am a very fast learner, I'm an honest, trustworthy person who will own up to mistakes, my parents taught me how to be a hard worker, and I can be funny in the right crowd :wink:
